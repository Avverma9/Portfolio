          As a web developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB,
          Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), I have gained valuable skills and
          experience in building full-stack web applications. Being a student of
          MCA (Master of Computer Applications) demonstrates my dedication to
          advancing my knowledge and expertise in the field of computer science.
          I am proud to say that I have completed many projects using Node.js
          and React.js, showcasing my proficiency in these technologies.
          Node.js, with its event-driven architecture, has allowed me to develop
          server-side applications and RESTful APIs, enabling efficient and
          scalable back-end development. React.js, on the other hand, has
          empowered me to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces,
          leveraging its component-based structure and virtual DOM.
